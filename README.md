A Parallax scrolling web experiment. (scrolling 'INTO' webpage)


### Info

CS TREK is a web experiment which introduces Computer Science's core concepts along, and analogous to a small space trip.

It offers an **'INTO'-parallax** scrolling experience; **unlike ever before** (June 2014), on the web, using just css3 and skrollr.js. The illusion of 3D space travel is created as you scroll.

### Tools Used

css3,
skrollr.js,
photoshop,
google app engine,
google analytics

### Date of completion

15 June 2014


### Details

Out of the league of Horizontal Parallax Scrolling Websites, this new web experiment claims to be an **'INTO' - PARALLAX**, where the viewer feels like going into a 3D space, while actually, it's just an illusion achieved by a perfect blend and sync of Parallax and Animation.

Using such engaging experience, the CORE CONCEPTS of Computer Science are also told **along & analogous** to a small space trip.

For achieving parallax, skrollr.js is used. And for achieving animations, css3 transforms are used.
Besides the parallax and animation effects, it's the perfect Synchronization between the parallax and animations; the depiction of Computer Science concepts in a creative way; and the superb illusion of 3D, that makes this web experiment **"UNLIKE EVER BEFORE"**.

This experiment has taken the parallax-scroll viewing to a whole new level, where you can created immersive 3D experiences with only 2D images.
